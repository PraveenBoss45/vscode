## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (inline suggestions, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Using Code Editor Themes with Python Projects

When working with Python projects in VS Code, selecting the right theme can significantly enhance your development experience and code readability.

### Tips for Theme Selection

* **Syntax Highlighting**: Choose themes that provide clear distinction between Python keywords, strings, comments, and function definitions
* **Contrast**: Select themes with appropriate contrast for extended coding sessions to reduce eye strain
* **Python Visualization**: Consider themes that work well with data visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) and Jupyter notebooks

### Recommended Practices

* Test themes with your typical Python codebase to ensure readability
* Consider different themes for different lighting conditions (light theme for bright environments, dark theme for low-light)
* Many popular themes like Dark+ (default), Monokai, and Solarized work excellently with Python syntax
* For data science work, ensure your theme displays dataframe outputs and plots clearly in the integrated terminal

You can change your theme by going to **File > Preferences > Theme > Color Theme** or by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+K Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+K Cmd+T` (macOS).

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  
* If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run a full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
